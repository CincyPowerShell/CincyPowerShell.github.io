### Scripting Puzzles
Love puzzles? We do, especially when they involve PowerShell and Test Driven Develoment (TDD)! We will provide Pester tests and you provide the code that passes the tests. This is a great way to see TDD in action and hopefullly get an idea of how to put it in practice in your daily work. Sapien will be providing the Pizza.
