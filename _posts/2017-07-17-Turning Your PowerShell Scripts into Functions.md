### **Turning your PowerShell Scripts into Functions**

Most of us write scripts on a daily or weekly basis for a particular task. Wouldn't it be great if you could share these scripts with your team? Join us as we show you how to convert a script to one or more functions. We will use these examples in future meetings to cover transforming a function to an advanced function (that accepts pipeline input), adding it to a module where it can be shared and consumed and finally writing tests around it so you can easily make changes in the future.

## Sponsor:

SAPIEN Technologies will be sponsoring the Cincinnati PowerShell User Group meeting and will be supplying the pizza!
