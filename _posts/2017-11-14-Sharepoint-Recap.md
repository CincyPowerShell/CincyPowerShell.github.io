## Cincinnati PowerShell User Group â€“ Sharepoint Recap


### *Recap - Sharepoint Online and OnPrem*

Another great meetup in Cincinnati at Max Training!  Zach opened our meeting showing off his [Printerceptor](https://github.com/zniezelski/Printerceptor) a great tool for managing printers on terminal servers and giving users rights to use extended features that might not be available with the printer by default through TS.

[Shane Young](https://twitter.com/ShanesCows), microsoft SharePoint MVP, gave us a great presentation on using PowerShell with Sharepoint.  He gave us the tools and resources to get started and going with our Sharepoint environments either on Prem or Online.

He also introduced us to the [patterns and practices tools for sharepoint](https://dev.office.com/patterns-and-practices), a great powershell module to fill in the gaps that are missing in the SharePoint module.

Shanes Presentation - Coming soon!

### Reminder
We are always looking for new content and/or speakers!  If you know someone or you are someone that would like to speak, we'd love to hear from you.  Please reach out to us at `info at cincypowershell dot org` and let us know.  Even if you just have something quick to show, a 10 minute demo can be a great thing to share, or get feedback on if you are working on a cool project or need some help.
