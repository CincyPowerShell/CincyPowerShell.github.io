### **PowerShell with SharePoint Online and On-Prem - Shane Young**

Have you ever wondered how to get started putting your PowerShell skills to work with Office 365 and more specifically SharePoint Online? Probably not but you should. In this session, Shane will introduce you to how to install Office 365 cmdlets and how to get connected to your services. Then after the sad trombone of how little you can do with SharePoint Online he will then point you to the Patterns and Practices cmdlets. They are everything and a bag of chips. The goal will be to make sure you feel empowered to manage O365 with PowerShell. Of course, he always does better if you ask lots of questions along the way so audience participation is required. Oh and another thing, NO PowerPoint, just demos and great conversation.

While his first love was SharePoint these days, he has expanded his love to PowerShell, Azure, and Office 365. Speaking of his passions, he covers all of those topics on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_OGRP8BYvtGB8eZdPG6Ng) or in a more traditional setting through his consulting company [Bold Zebras](https://www.boldzebras.com).
