## Customizing your PowerShell Environment Recap

Another great meetup thanks to all who came out!  

Dave started us out by showing us how he reverse engineered some encryption libraries and created a powershell wrapper to encrypt/decrypt some database rows, thanks Dave!

Matt McNabb ([@mcnabbmh](https://twitter.com/mcnabbmh)) showed us how to be more efficient in our everyday PowerShell Admin sessions using.  We went over Profile best practices and tips/tricks, $PSDefaultParameterValues, PowerShell Prompts, secure credential storage / usage, argument completers, and extending your editors.  I'm already more productive!

We also brought up Pester, the PowerShell testing framework which brought a lot of interest, look for a future talk around Pester and how to get started with testing.  [Start here if you're interested in Testing/Pester!](http://scottmuc.com/blog/development/pester-bdd-for-the-system-administrator/)

Matt has lots more links and resources in his Github repo related to the talk
