### **PowerShell and SQL Roundup**

This year we have talked about manipulating text, CSV, even Excel Files with PowerShell. Take your PowerShell skills to the next level by querying or manipulating SQL databases directly through PowerShell. 
We will talk the pros and cons of the SQL PowerShell module vs manipulating SQL with .NET methods. These skills will take you one step closer to treating "all the things" as code.

## Sponsor:

SAPIEN Technologies will be sponsoring the Cincinnati PowerShell User Group meeting and will be supplying the pizza!
