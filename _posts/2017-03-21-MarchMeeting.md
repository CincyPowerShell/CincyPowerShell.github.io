### *Customizing your PowerShell Environment*

Despite all of PowerShell's benefits, sometimes working with a command-line tool can be tedious and repetitive and some days your fingers will hate you. As you begin using PowerShell more and more in your daily work, it's essential that you learn to set up your environment to work for you. You'll get work done more quickly and you can amaze your co-workers with your lightning fast command-line skills. Join Cincy PowerShell on March 23rd and learn about building your custom PowerShell toolset with profiles, default parameters, completers and more.
