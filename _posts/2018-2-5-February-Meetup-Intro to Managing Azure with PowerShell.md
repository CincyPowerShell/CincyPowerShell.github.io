## Intro to Managing Azure with PowerShell with Thomas Rayner

If you're only using the web portal to manage your Azure resources and infrastructure, you're not even using half of the tools available to you. The AzureRM PowerShell module is a flexible, robust tool for working with Azure. There's no limit to the Azure-related tasks you can perform in PowerShell, and a bunch of advantages for doing so.

In this session, Microsoft Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP Thomas Rayner will introduce you to using the AzureRM PowerShell module, and managing your Azure resources effectively and efficiently with PowerShell.
