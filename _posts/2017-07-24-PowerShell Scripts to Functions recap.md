## Cincinnati PowerShell User Group â€“ PowerShell Scripts to Functions Recap


### *Recap - PowerShell Scripts to Functions*

Great turnout and thanks to all that came!  We had a few new faces, which is always a good thing.  We looked at a script that was written to remove software from a text file with PC names. As a group, we thought through the ways to create a general purpose function that we would reuse and take advantage of the builtin PowerShell goodness. We started with the Cmdlet - Advanced Function (complete) snippet as a template and experimented with the pros/cons of using parameter validation vs writing your own code to handle validation. The Invoke-ArbitraryCode.ps1 file is what we developed as a group but feel free to submit a Pull Request with suggestions. You can find all the code [here](https://github.com/CincyPowerShell/CincyPowerShell.github.io/tree/master/presentations/2017-07).  

### Reminder
We are always looking for new content and/or speakers!  If you know someone or you are someone that would like to speak, we'd love to hear from you.  Please reach out to us at `info at cincypowershell dot org` and let us know.  Whether you have something quick to show or are interested in doing a 30 minute talk. Bringing things to the group is a perfect opportunity to get feedback or assistance on a project or idea that you are working on.
