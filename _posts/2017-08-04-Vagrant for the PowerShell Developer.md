### **Vagrant for the PowerShell developer with Alex McFarland**

Are you guilty of grousing at developers about the stability of their applications then testing your PowerShell scripts in production? If you were to stand a Windows server in a local lab from scratch to test a script, application, or scenario, how long would it take you? Come join us and learn how to quickly create Windows environments with Vagrant that you can bundle with your PowerShell modules and easily share with your team members, even if they are on Linux or a Mac.

### About the Speaker
Alex McFarland is a Systems Engineer working as a contractor for the U.S. Government specializing in the design and management of highly available web applications in Windows environments. He is a PowerShell fanatic who enjoys optimizing everything from software deployments to dinner.
