-   PowerShell DSC is maturing and you should start experimenting with it, if you have not already done so. 
    -   Here are some resources to help get you started - https://github.com/PowerShellOrg/dsc-summit-precon
-   Testing and Documentation is important and should become part of your daily workflow:
    -   Testing and documenting helps improve code quality, quality enables fast delivery speed
    -   Test and write help as your code and make changes, it makes the task less daunting by integrating it into your workflow
    -   Test Driven Development (TDD) and Help Driven Development (HDD) help you to plan before you even write a single line of code.
    -   Remember your help is your contract with your user, even if the user is you in 6 months or a year.
    -   PSScriptAnalyser is available in the PowerShell Gallery or on GitHub - https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer
-   Pester is a testing framework for PowerShell, if you don't know it, learn it, it will become an essential tool in your PowerShell Toolkit. https://github.com/pester/Pester

-   The main part of our talk was around Steven Murawski and Michael Greene's Release Pipeline Model. http://aka.ms/thereleasepipelinemodel
    -   PSDeploy is another build automation tool to help you move one step closer to a Continuous Deployment model. https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy
    -   psake is also another viable option for automating your build pipeline. https://github.com/psake/psake
    -   Operation Validation Framework is a set of tools for validating the operations of a system. This allows you to execute Pester tests that you have created to validate operations of an entire system (rather than just features). https://github.com/PowerShell/Operation-Validation-Framework
    -   This is a great follow up to the release pipeline article https://devblackops.io/building-a-simple-release-pipeline-in-powershell-using-psake-pester-and-psdeploy/
