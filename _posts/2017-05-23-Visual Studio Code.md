### *Visual Studio Code (VSCode)*

You have probably heard of VSCode and might have even tried it out. If you haven't or if it's been a while since you've tried it, you are missing out! VSCode has come a long way in the last couple of months and is quickly positioning itself as the IDE of choice; not just for Powershell developers but is also gaining traction in the development community at large. Come learn what VSCode is, why it is an essential tool in your toolbox and how it can help you on your DevOps journey!

## Sponsor:

SAPIEN Technologies will be sponsoring the Cincinnati PowerShell User Group meeting and will be supplying the pizza!
