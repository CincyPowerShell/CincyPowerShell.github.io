### **Accessing RESTful Web Services from PowerShell**

PowerShell has cmdlets for just about every on premise system you support. What happens when you need to access cloud based, non-Microsoft applications? Sometimes you need to do things where there are no available cmdlets. Many of your on premise browser based systems and many internet based systems offer RESTful web service APIs that can be access by C# code, JavaScript and PowerShell. In this presentation we will explore using PowerShell to access RESTful web services to query, insert, update and delete "things"!
